Callback:
A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Callback Hell:
Callback hell refers to a situation in asynchronous programming where callbacks are nested within other callbacks multiple levels deep, making code difficult to read, maintain, and debug. This often results in a "pyramid" or "arrow" structure in the code.
